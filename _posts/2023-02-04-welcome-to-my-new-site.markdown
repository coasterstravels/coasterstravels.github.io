Welcome to the website of Coasters and Travels! This was a LONG time coming, but I had to get my lazy butt up and get this done. Well better late then never right? So what's the goal of this site? The same goal as my YouTube channel: showcase my love and passion for rollercoasters, theme parks, and travels. The site is super bare bones, because I wanted to get this on the road ASAP. For now I'll be posting things like trip reports, coaster and park reviews, and I'll also be posting new videos on here! 

Over time I'll be adding new features to the site, but for now I'm just glad I have something to start off with. Again, welcome to Coasters and Travels!
